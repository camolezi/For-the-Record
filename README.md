# for-the-record
Privacy focused open source audio journal


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

for-the-record is a client-side only audio journal built with privacy in mind.

Here's why:
* Client-side only
* Works offline
* Protected by password
* Encrypts your audio data

This application is still in development, thus some functionality and features are still missing.

This app shouldn't be used as a finalized product. With that said, feel free to check the app out on this link:
